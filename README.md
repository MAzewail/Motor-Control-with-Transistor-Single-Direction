## Project Overview

The Motor Control with Transistor (Single Direction) project allows you to control the rotation of a motor in a single direction using a transistor as a switch. The transistor acts as a gatekeeper, allowing or blocking the flow of current to the motor. By controlling the transistor's state, you can control the motor's rotation.

## Features

- Control the motor's rotation in a single direction.
- Utilize a transistor as a switch to regulate current flow.
- Simple and cost-effective motor control solution.

## Hardware Requirements

To set up and run this project, you will need the following hardware components:

- Arduino or compatible microcontroller board.
- NPN transistor (e.g., 2N2222, BC547, etc.).
- Diode (e.g., 1N4001) for back-emf protection.
- DC motor for control.
- Resistor(s) for circuit connections.
- Jumper wires for circuit connections.
- Breadboard or PCB for assembling the circuit.
